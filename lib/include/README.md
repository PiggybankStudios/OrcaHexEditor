This folder should contain copies of all the include folders from libraries that the project depends on.

The list of libraries is given below:

# gylib
https://www.github.com/PiggybankStudios/gylib
gylib folder

# nanosvg
https://github.com/memononen/nanosvg
nanosvg folder

# Orca (optional, as reference)
https://www.github.com/orca-app/orca
orca folder
Only need the src and doc folders, since they are referenced by the .sublime-project to make api lookup easy
